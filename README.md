# 🎲 Unique Square Generator

> A simple, fun Python utility that generates **unique random square numbers** from a given base range. Ideal for math games, pattern simulations, and randomness-based tasks!

---

## 🔢 What it does

This script randomly picks **base numbers** between your chosen `min_base` and `max_base`, then returns their **squares**, without repeating any base twice.

For example:
- base = 12 → 144
- base = 33 → 1089

Once a base is used, it's never repeated!
